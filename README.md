Sentiment Analysis of comments from Robot Dance Video "Do you love me?" from Boston Dynamics.

This chapter presents an analysis of user comments on Boston Dynamics' dancing robot video on YouTube, focusing on the overestimation of artificial intelligence (AI). The study explores how viewers perceive and comment on the robots' abilities, particularly in terms of performance, humanization, and autonomy. The research aims to understand the impact of overestimation on the overall sentiment towards AI. The analysis, based on our manual labeling of 1000 YouTube comments, reveals that overestimation is prevalent, with 32\% of comments showing various forms of overestimation. The sentiments are diverse, with 35\% positive, 30\% negative, and 37\% neutral comments. Correlation analysis indicates that comments overestimating autonomy correlate with negative sentiments, while humanization and performance overestimation have weaker associations. The findings suggest that overestimation, especially in terms of autonomy, is linked to a more negative perception of AI. Humanization alone does not necessarily lead to strong positive or negative sentiments. Additionally, we experimented with using GPT-4 to label the data in our study. We concluded that while this approach may have potential for future research, it did not provide convincing results for our current analysis. The study contributes to understanding public perceptions of AI and highlights the importance of accurate portrayals in media to avoid misconceptions.
